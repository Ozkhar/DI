# DI
Dependency Injection is a pattern part of SOLID Best practices. This corresponds to decoupled components.
With dependency injection high level modules, classes are not tight to low level ones. Rather an interface is used to inject to
the constructor the specific functionality that is intended to happen. This project shows an implementation of dependency injection which facilitates the unit testing. For the testing part a mock class is used.
